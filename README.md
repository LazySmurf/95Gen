<p align="center">This tool is designed for educational purposes only. Windows 95 belongs to Microsoft Corporation, all rights are reserved and belong to them.</p>
<p align="center">As Windows 95 security has been defeated for many years now, this tool was designed as a fun and quick challenge for myself to write a working keygen, as well as for others to study and see how it is done.</p>
